Fields like physics, chemistry, and computer science use scientific techniques to study a single subject, but not so with data science. Data science is a _method_ of science, not a _branch_ of science. 

Data science is similar to experimental science. It uses a specific tool to solve the problems described by philosophers of science. Experimental scientists rely on experiments to solve these problems, and data scientists rely on data. 

This chapter will describe the problems that data scientists attempt to solve, as well as the methods they use to solve them. It introduces data science as a specific method of reasoning that addresses the questions "What can you know?" and "How can you know it?". This method of reasoning guides how you will use techniques that you will learn in later chapters, techniques like machine learning, statistical modelling, and visualization.
