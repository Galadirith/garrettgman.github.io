## Science vs. science

Library science. Managerial science. Computer science. The word "science" is a giveaway. If a field has "science" in its name, you can bet that its practioners do not wear lab coats and talk about experiments. They wear ties and talk about how you should pay them for their expertise.

The "real" sciences call themselves things like physics, chemistry, and biology -- not library science, managerial science, or computer science.

If a field has to claim that it is a science, it is usually not -- library science, political science, computer science, managerial science. 

## Vague

Data science is a term that was used before it was defined.

O'Reilly publishes nine books on data science and one of them is named "What is Data Science?" When you open any of them you should ask yourself, what am I getting into?

(It doesn't answer the question). As a term, data science is so broadly used. Whenever you open a book on data science, you should ask, "What am I getting into?" Data science is two overlapping things. Like computer science or library science, it is a collection of knowledge. But unlike these subjects.

that you are right to ask, "What am I getting into?" when you open a book on the subject. This book will show you a very specific part of data science: it's scientific core.

Data science has a dual nature, which is part of its confusion. On the one hand, data science refers to a psuedo-academic field. The term science in its name tells you that the field is not an actual branch of science -- like physics, chemistry, or biology -- but a collection of useful techniques that pretend to be scientific, like library science, management science, or computer science. This type of data science involves the best practices for storing, searching and crunching massive data sets on finite hardware. That's not the data science we'll cover here.

## Method vs branch vs body of knowledge

Data science is a _method_ of science. This sets it apart from other fields that are _branches_ of science. A branch of science uses scientific techniques to study a single subject. For example, physicists study physical systems, chemists study chemical systems, and biologists study living systems. But data science is different.  

I'll teach you how to visualize data and do statistics. After all, this is the type of data science that R was designed to do. However, the book will focus on a more basic—and more important—aspect of data science.

At another level, data science is a _body of knowledge_, a collection of useful information related to a specific task. For example, you've probably heard of other bodies of knowledge. Library science collects the best ways to run a library, managerial science collects the best ways to manage a business, and computer science collects the best ways to program a computer. Bodies of knowledge usually have the word "science" in their title, so its no surprise that the term "data science" came to be used this way. Data scientists collect the best ways to store, retrieve, and manage data. Or some of them do. This is useful information. In fact, it is probably what most people in industry think of when they think of "data science," but it is not the type of data science that I will teach you.

 I won't teach you about hadoop clusters or non-relational databases, and I will only teach you the most useful parts of statistics. Those are useful things for a data scientist to know about, but to study them now would be like putting the cart before the horse.

## The method of data science

You can think of science as a collection of methods that use observations to discover natural laws. Data science is one of those methods. It uses a specific property of observations to reveal natural laws, and that property is variation.

## Modelling

In practice, you will not have enough variables or observations to clearly identify a natural law. Instead, you must estimate laws—often incomplete laws—with a model.

As a data scientist, you will not know ahead of time which variables are in a natural law. This makes it difficult to collect relevant data. As a result, you might not collect data on each variable in the law. You also will not have enough observations to clearly identify a law.
