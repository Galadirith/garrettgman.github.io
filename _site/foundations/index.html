  <h1 class="page-title">Foundations of Data Science</h1>
  <p>Data science is a <em>method</em> of science. This sets it apart from other fields that are <em>branches</em> of science. A branch of science uses scientific techniques to study a single subject. For example, physicists study physical systems, chemists study chemical systems, and computer scientists study computation. But data science is different.  </p>

<p>Data scientists study a method that anyone can use to solve scientific problems. You can think of data science as a complement to experimental science. Experimental scientists use the experimental method to solve scientific problems, and data scientists use the data science method. Many scientists use both.</p>

<p>This chapter will describe the problems that data scientists attempt to solve, as well as the method they use to solve them. It introduces data science as a specific method of reasoning that addresses the questions &quot;What can you know?&quot; and &quot;How can you know it?&quot; This method of reasoning guides the techniques that you will learn in later chapters -- techniques like machine learning, statistical modelling, and visualization.</p>

<h3>Test Yourself</h3>

<p>These exercises are more open-ended than the exercises in the following chapters. In fact, some of the questions below do not have answers, but they are still very important. You should have an opinion that you can defend for each of these topics.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Explain data science</strong></p>

<p>Your boss walks in and he&#39;s furious. You gave him a prediction that turned out wrong, and the company lost millions.</p>

<p>He&#39;s suddenly very interested in cutting costs. He has mathematicians to crunch numbers, and computer scientists to write programs. In a menacing voice, he leans in and asks, &quot;Why do I need a data scientist?&quot;</p>

<p>a. Explain how data science is different than math.
b. Explain how data science is different than computer science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infinite regress</strong> </p>

<p>Philosophers describe knowledge as justified true belief, which deparates beliefs that are knowlege from beliefs that are guesses. But what justifies a belief? Another piece of knowledge, which requires its own justification. This creates a problem of infinite regress. To know anything, you must know an infinite number fo beliefs or know something that does not need to be justified. Philosophers call such pieces of knowledge foundational beliefs (and argue about whether they exist). How does science solve the infinite regress problem?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem of induction</strong></p>

<p>Data science relies heavily on induction, a common form of reasoning that cannot be logically justified. Inductive reasoning draws a conclusion that states more than what is implied in the premises. For example, the following inductive argument draws a conclusion that goes beyond what is described in the first two statements.</p>

<p>The high temperature was ninety degrees yesterday.
The high temperature was ninety degrees today.
Therefore, the high temperature will be ninety degrees tomorrow.</p>

<p>In essence, an inductive argument assumes an unstated premise, that the unobserved will resemble the observed.</p>

<p>Inductive reasoning is an important method of learning that has led to many scientific discoveries. However, it suffers a serious problem. It is difficult to prove that induction is a reasonable thing to do. Consider an obvious approach. You may argue</p>

<p>Induction has worked on occasion A.
Induction has worked on occasion B.
Therefore, induction will work in the future.</p>

<p>This argument only holds if you assume that future cases of induction (the unobserved) will resemble previous cases of induction, which were successful (the observed). In other words, this line of reasoning is circular: it relies on induction to justify induction.</p>

<p>David Hume described this as the <em>problem of induction</em>. He asserted that induction cannot be logically justified. Since then, philosophers have largely confirmed his assertion.</p>

<p>Is induction a reasonable way to learn about the world? How do you justify using inductive methods in data science? </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synthetic a priori knowledge</strong> - Given the problem of induction, many people prefer deductive reasoning. This is deductive reasoning. It is logically valid, but does it reveal new knowledge? Can any logically valid reasoning reveal new knowledge?</p></li>
