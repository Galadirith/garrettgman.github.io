We all know what _Science_ is: the scholarly way of learning that depends on reasoning and observation. A scientist conducts experiments, makes measurements and thereby learns about the world. But what is _Data Science_?

Data science begins with the second measurement. Whenever you measure the same thing twice—provided you measure it precisely enough—you will get two results. This phenomenon creates uncertainy, and it creates opportunity.

This book will teach you how to work with that uncertainty and how to capture those opportunities. It will also teach you how to handle the other things that come along with the second measurement. Things like:

* **Data Wrangling** - You now have a history of observations to keep track of. How do you do it?
* **Exploration** - Do your measurements provide evidence of a relationship? Patterns are easy to miss in data, but easy to spot in graphs.
* **Modelling** - If your values disagree how do you estimate the "truth?" How do you predict the next value? 
* **Reports** - How do you decipher your findings for people who do not understand data science and its methods?

Along the way, the book will present the statstistical world view, a way of seeing the world that permits understanding in the face of uncertainty, and simplicity in the face of complexity. It will also teach you how to use R, a very versatile computer language.
