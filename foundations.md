### Chapter 1 - Science
The two premises of science. How and why to find natural laws.

***
1. Scientific worldview
    1. Natural laws defined  
        * Natural laws let scientists explain, predict, and control natural phenomena
    2. Natural laws deal with variables and they have a unit  
        * Variable defined
        * Unit of analysis defined  
    3. The best way to learn about natural laws is to observe them  
        * Value defined  
        * observation defined 
            * values must be similar to be part of an observation
            * observations should match units of analysis to reveal a law
    4. Observations provide evidence about natural laws.
        * Scientists use observations in two ways:
            i. To test hypotheses
            ii. To discover laws

2. Hypothesis testing
    1. We approach the world not through observations but ideas.
        * Hypothesis defined
        * Observations can highlight incorrect ideas
    2. To test a hypothesis
        * deduce a testable prediction from the hypothesis
        * observe whether the prediction is true
            * often by designing an experiment
        * if the prediction is false, disregard the hypothesis ( or the observation)
        * if the prediction is correct, consider the hypothesis "not yet disproven"
        * Science progresses by gradually refining our set of ideas about the world
    3. This method has played an influential role in science
        * it has several names: scientific method, hypothetico deductive method, conjecture and refutation
        * It will also play an influential role in data science
    4. The method is logically foolproof, but poses some problems
        * it cannot prove that a hypothesis is correct
            * scientists respond by treating everything with skepticism
            * it does not explain how to come up with ideas in the first place

3. Discovery
    1. Data provides a way to discover new laws
        * Data defined - A collection of values each associated with a variable and an observation
            * Note: this definition does not cover "unstructured 'data'", which we will not consider in this book
    2. Laws appear as patterns in data
        * the human mind is not well suited to spot patterns in raw data, so scientists rely on several tools
    3. To discover a law:
        i. collect data
        ii. visualize data
        iii. search for patterns with an algorithm
    4. This method is ver useful, but has some weaknesses of its own
        * Unlike hypothesis testing, this method is not logically foolproof
            * problem of induction
        * a finite set of points cannot uniquely identify a law
        * missing variables will appear as noise in a pattern

4. Summary
    1. Scientists use observations to understand the natural laws of the universe
    2. They iterate between explorations and discovery, and confirmation and testing
    3. These principles provide a program that guides data science.
        * They guide all of science, not just data science.
        * However, the principles are not well-suited for the universe as it actually is
    4. Data scientists apply the principles of science to a more complex, but realistic context.
        * They adapt the principles of science to variation, a reality that affects all natural phenomena.
