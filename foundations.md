title: Foundations of Data Science
---

Data science is a _method_ of science. This makes it different from other fields that are _branches_ of science. A branch of science uses scientific techniques to study a single subject. For example, physics studies physical systems, chemistry studies chemical systems, and computer science studies computation. But data science is different.  

Data science focuses on a general method that scientists use to solve problems. You can think of data science as a complement to experimental science. Experimental scientists use the experimental method to solve scientific problems, and data scientists use the method of data science. 

This chapter will describe the problems that data scientists attempt to solve, as well as the method they use to solve them. It introduces data science as a specific method of reasoning that addresses the questions "What can you know?" and "How can you know it?" This method of reasoning guides the techniques that you will learn in later chapters -- techniques like machine learning, statistical modelling, and visualization.
