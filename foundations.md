title: Foundations of Data Science
---

Data science is a _method_ of science, which sets it apart from other fields of science. Many fields use scientific techniques to study a single subject. For example, physicists study physical systems, chemists study chemical systems, and computer scientists study computation. But data scientists might study each of these things and more.

Data science is similar to experimental science. It uses a specific tool to solve the general problems described by philosophers of science. Experimental scientists use experiments to solve these problems, and data scientists use data. 

This chapter will describe the problems that data scientists attempt to solve, as well as the methods they use to solve them. It introduces data science as a specific method of reasoning that addresses the questions "What can you know?" and "How can you know it?" This method of reasoning guides the techniques that you will learn in later chapters -- techniques like machine learning, statistical modelling, and visualization.
