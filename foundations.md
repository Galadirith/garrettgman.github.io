Data science is a _method_ of science. This sets it apart from other fields that are _branches_ of science. A branch of science uses scientific techniques to study a single subject. For example, physicists study physical systems, chemists study chemical systems, and biologists study living systems. But data science is different.  

Data scientists study a method that anyone can use to solve scientific problems. You can think of data science as a complement to experimental science. Experimental scientists use the experimental method to solve scientific problems, and data scientists use the data science method. Many scientists use both.

The data science method relies on data, a tool that makes it easy to discover scientific relationships. However, as a tool, data can be misleading. Data creates specific illusions that you must be able to recognize and work with to make progress.

This chapter will describe the problems that data scientists attempt to solve, as well as the methods that they use to solve them. It introduces data science as a specific method of reasoning that matches the structure of data to the structure of scientific laws. This method of reasoning guides the techniques that you will learn in later chaptersâ€”techniques like machine learning, statistical modelling, and visualization.

## The data science worldview

Science is based on a simple idea, that the best way to learn about the world is to observe it. Data scientists extend this idea by studying measurements, a specifc type of observation. A _measurement_ is an observation that is 

1. made with a reproducible method 
2. recorded in a precise way 

Every measurement creates a _value_, a piece of information that describes a specific part of the world at a specific time. 

The rigor of measurement reveals a surprising phenomenon: if you measure the same quantity twice, you will observe two different values, so long as you measure precisely enough. This is true of any quantity that you choose to measure. Data scientists call this phenomenon _variation_, and it completely shapes how we learn about the world. 

Variation occurs for two reasons. First, the universe changes constantly. For example, the temperature of the air changes from time to time, and the salinity of the sea changes from place to place. Any pair of precise measurements will reflect these changes, even if the changes are minute.

Second, tiny measurement errors occur each time you make a measurement. Your hand may shake slightly, a glass lens may swell, and so on. As a result, it is very difficult to make two measurements under the exact same conditions. You can see the effect of these errors when you measure something that should be constant. The table below shows the earliest reliable measurements of the speed of light. The speed of light is a universal constant that should never vary, but the measurements of the speed of light vary greatly due to measurement errors.

Unfortunately, when measuring constants it is not clear which measurements should be trusted and which are affected by errors. 

### The goal of data science

Variation creates a goal for data scientists. Data scientists try to discover the causes of variation in the natural world. In particular, data scientists try to understand, predict, and control the outcomes of events and processes that vary. For example, a data scientist may try to determine why annual rainfall in the midwest varies from year to year. Or a data scientist may try to determine why some automobiles produce more $SO_{2}$ than others, and then make recommendations for lowering the $SO_{2}$ emissions of all cars.

To do this, data scientists treat everything that can be measured as a _variable_, a quantity or quality whose value can vary from measurement to measurement. Data scientists then try to predict which values a variable will take under specific sets of conditions.

It is important to understand the difference between a variable and a value. A variable is a general quantity or quality that you can measure, such as height, weight, or the outcome of an event. A value is a state that a variable can have when you measure it. For example, the variable height can have values like 60 inches and 61.3 inches. A variable that describes a coin flip (which is an event) can have the values "heads" and "tails." 

Throughout the book, I will use capital letters to denote variables and lower case letters to denote values. So for example, we can speak of the variable $H$. If we measure it, we might find that it is equal to the value $h$.

$$H = h$$

But if we measure $H$ a second time, we might expect it to be equal to a different value, $h_{2}$.

$$H = h_{2}$$

The goal of data science is to understand when a variable like $H$ will equal the value $h$, and when it will equal the value $h_{2}$. Data scientists reduce the uncertainty associated with a variable by describing how it varies and predicting its value. To do this, data scientists rely on a second phenomenon also revealed by measurement.

### Covariation

The second phenomenon that measurement reveals is that many variables appear to be related to each other. In other words, the values of one variable often seem to correspond to the values of other variables in a systematic way. For example, the value of a child's weight tends to increase as the value of the child's height increases. The number of naps that a child takes tends to decrease as the value of the child's age increases. This correspondence between variables is known as _covariation_. 

Covariation is exactly what you would expect if you believe that the universe operates according to laws of cause and effect (and most scientists do). According to this view, the value of each variable is an effect determined by a system of causes, and each cause in the system is itself a variable.

Let's make this clear with an example. Imagine rolling a pair of dice. You can denote the sum of the dice as a variable, $S$, and you can speculate that it is determined by the values of the individual dice, $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$, in a specific way. 

$$S = D_{1} + D_{2}$$

This simple system has an effect, $S$, and two causes, $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$. I prefer to refer to $S$ as the output of the system. $S$ is determined in a causal manner by $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$, the inputs of the system. If you change the value of $D_{1}$ or $D_{2}$, the value of $S$ will change in response. If you collect data on the system, the causal relationship would appear as a strong covariation between $S$, $D_{1}$, and $D_{2}$. Whenever the values of $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are high, the value of S will be high. Whenever the values of $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are low, the value of $S$ will be low.

Whenever a set of variables determines the value of an output variable, you can express the relationship as a formula, like $S = D_{1} + D_{2}$. For convenience, I'm going to call this type of formula a _scientific law_. These formulas are scientific because they deal with quantities or qualities that can be observed (at least in theory). These formulas are laws because they describe law-like relationships. The relationship must always hold so long as the set of input variables _does_ determine the value of the output variable in a causal manner.

### Scientific laws

You've seen scientific laws in many places. For example, two familiar scientific laws are 

$$E=Mc^{2}$$

and 

$$F=MA$$

The first law states that the energy content of a system ($E$) is equal to the mass of the system ($M$) multiplied by the speed of light squared ($c^{2}$). The second law explains that force exerted upon an object ($F$) is equal to the mass of the object ($M$) multiplied by its acceleration ($A$). 

In theses laws, the quantities $E$, $M$, $F$, and $A$ are all variables. The quantity $c$ is a constant value, in theory.

Scientists search for scientific laws because laws provide a way to reason about variation. Laws explain why and how the values of a variable vary. They also help scientists understand, predict, and control natural behavior.

First, you can use a law to understand the world. $E = Mc^{2}$ explains why plutonium creates a nuclear explosion when detonated. A piece of plutonium contains an amount of energy equal to the mass of the piece times the speed of light squared. When plutonium is detonated, an atomic reaction converts some of this mass to energy. Scientists have used the law to calculate that about one gram of plutonium was converted to energy when the United States detonated a plutonium bomb above Nagasaki, Japan in WWII. One gram of plutonium would weigh about as much as a paper clip.

Second, you can use a law to make predictions. For example, you could use the law $F = MA$ to predict how fast a nuclear bomb will accelerate once you drop it out of a plane. Substitute the force exerted by gravity for $F$, the mass of the bomb for $M$, and then do some simple algebra to get $A$.

Third, you can use a scientific law to control a system. Imagine that you would like to design a plane that can accelerate fast enough after dropping a nuclear bomb to escape the resulting explosion. The law $F = MA$ tells you how to do this. You can make a plane accelerate faster by decreasing its mass or by giving it an engine that can exert more force on the plane. Given this application, Iâ€™d do both.



Data provides the ideal tool to find laws because it is a record of covariation.
